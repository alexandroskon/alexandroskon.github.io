  TITLE = {Viscous-inviscid fluid-structure interaction method for the analysis of multielement morphing airfoils},
  abstract={In the present diploma thesis, the development of a two-body viscous-inviscid interaction method (Foil2E) is described as an extension of the Foil2W code of the Laboratory of Aerodynamics of the School of Mechanical Engineering of National Technical University of Athens, based on the XFOIL code. The method is weakly coupled with ABAQUS to perform fluid-structure interaction analysis for morphing multielement airfoils using Nitinol wire actuators. Firstly, the basic principles of VII methods and the fluid phenomena that occur and need to be modeled are presented. Then, the panel method for the purely inviscid flow is described as well as the viscous displacement model for the equivalent inviscid flow (EIF) and the integral boundary layer model including the e^n transition criterion. Finally, the thesis concludes with the numerical formulation for the VII as it was implemented in Foil2E, the validation of the code using experimental data from AGARD and the results of the FSI analysis of an airfoil with morphing fowler flap. Viscous-inviscid interaction codes are well suited for rapid and interactive aerodynamic analysis. Hence, Foil2E code could be of great use in the analysis of high-lift slotted airfoils, biplane and canard configurations. Moreover, due to the low computational cost and time of VII methods, the present method is promising for rapid quasi-3D FSI computations including the material models for Nitinol, as developed by the Structural Analysis and Smart Materials (SAAM) group of the department.},

  TITLE = {Inverse problems in fluid dynamics for magnetic resonance velocimetry},
  abstract={I formulate a digital twin approach to the reconstruction of velocity fields from noisy and sparse
magnetic resonance velocimetry signals. The method learns the most probable fluid dynamics
model that fits the data by solving a Bayesian inverse Navier–Stokes boundary value problem. This
jointly reconstructs and segments the velocity field, and at the same time infers hidden quantities
such as the hydrodynamic pressure and the wall shear stress, as well as their uncertainties. Using
a Bayesian framework, I regularize the problem by introducing a priori information about the
unknown parameters in the form of Gaussian random fields. This prior information is updated
using the Navier–Stokes problem, an energy-based segmentation functional, and by requiring that
the reconstruction is consistent with the signals. I create an algorithm that solves this inverse
problem, and first test it for noisy synthetic images of 2D flow in a simulated aortic aneurysm.
I then extend the method to noisy, sparsely-sampled signals, and test it for experimental flow
through a converging nozzle. I find that the method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the
velocity fields from sparsely-sampled (15% sampling), low (∼10) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals,
and that the reconstructed velocity field is almost identical to that derived from fully-sampled
(100% sampling) high (>40) SNR signals of the same flow. Finally, I implement the same algorithm
in 3D and test it for an experimental flow through a 3D-printed physical model of an aortic arch. I
show that the method can successfully reconstruct noisy flows in realistic geometries and high
Reynolds numbers. Further, the method naturally extends to 3D periodic and unsteady flows, and
its computational complexity can be substantially decreased if an adaptive discretization method
(e.g. wavelets) is used. The reconstruction of in vivo cardiovascular and porous media flows are
among the most exciting applications of this work.},
