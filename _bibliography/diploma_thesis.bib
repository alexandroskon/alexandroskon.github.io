  TITLE = {Viscous-inviscid fluid-structure interaction method for the analysis of multielement morphing airfoils},
  abstract={In the present diploma thesis, the development of a two-body viscous-inviscid interaction method (Foil2E) is described as an extension of the Foil2W code of the Laboratory of Aerodynamics of the School of Mechanical Engineering of National Technical University of Athens, based on the XFOIL code. The method is weakly coupled with ABAQUS to perform fluid-structure interaction analysis for morphing multielement airfoils using Nitinol wire actuators. Firstly, the basic principles of VII methods and the fluid phenomena that occur and need to be modeled are presented. Then, the panel method for the purely inviscid flow is described as well as the viscous displacement model for the equivalent inviscid flow (EIF) and the integral boundary layer model including the e^n transition criterion. Finally, the thesis concludes with the numerical formulation for the VII as it was implemented in Foil2E, the validation of the code using experimental data from AGARD and the results of the FSI analysis of an airfoil with morphing fowler flap. Viscous-inviscid interaction codes are well suited for rapid and interactive aerodynamic analysis. Hence, Foil2E code could be of great use in the analysis of high-lift slotted airfoils, biplane and canard configurations. Moreover, due to the low computational cost and time of VII methods, the present method is promising for rapid quasi-3D FSI computations including the material models for Nitinol, as developed by the Structural Analysis and Smart Materials (SAAM) group of the department.},
